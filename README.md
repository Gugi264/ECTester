Tests support and behavior of elliptic curve cryptography implementations on JavaCards (`TYPE_EC_FP` and `TYPE_EC_F2M`) and on selected software libraries.
For more information on ECC support on JavaCards see the [github page](https://crocs-muni.github.io/ECTester/), with results, tables and docs.

## Setup

ECTester uses ant. There are three parts of ECTester, the JavaCard applet used for testing, the reader app which controls it and the standalone app which tests software libraries.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive       # To initialize submodules.
ant -f build-reader.xml package               # To build the reader tool (jar) -> "dist/ECTesterReader.jar"
ant -f build-standalone.xml package           # To build the standalone tool (jar) -> "dist/ECTesterStandalone.jar"
ant -f build-applet.xml build                 # To build the applet (cap) -> "applet/ectester.cap".
```
Build produces both a lightweight version of the JARs and a full version of the JARs with dependencies included, the latter has the `*-dist.jar` suffix.
The standalone build tries building test binaries for all the supported libraries, and silently fails if the library is not properly supported.

The applet comes in two flavors, targeting JavaCard 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. The 2.2.2 version supports extended length APDUs which are necessary for some commands
to work properly. Use the `cap` ant property to specify which CAP file to build, either `ectester221.cap` or `ectester222.cap`.

To build the 221 version do:
```bash
ant -f build-applet.xml build -Dcap=ectester221.cap
```

## JavaCard testing

1. Upload `applet/ectester.cap` using your favorite tool (e.g., [GlobalPlatformPro tool](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatform)) or the `build-applet.xml` ant file.
2. Run `java -jar dist/ECTesterReader.jar -t`.
3. Inspect output log with annotated results.

Following operations are tested in the default test suite:
- Allocation of new KeyPair class for specified parameters
- Generation of KeyPair with default curve
- Setting of custom curve and KeyPair generation
- Generation of shared secret via ECDH
- Signature via ECDSA

See `java -jar ECTesterReader.jar -h`, `java -jar ECTesterReader.jar -ls` and [DOCS](docs/TESTS.md) for more.

### Actions

#### Export
`-e / --export`

Exports the default curves (if any) that are preset on the card.
Use with `-o / --output [out_file]` to output the curve parameters to a file.
For format of this file see [FORMAT](docs/FORMAT.md).

#### Test
`-t / --test [test_suite]`

Perform support, performance and vulnerability tests of ECC.

To select which tests will be performed, it is possible to enter the test suite name with a suffix
which specifies the number of the first test to be run, and optionally the number of the last test to be run as `-t <test_suite>[:start_index[:stop_index]]`.

Use with `-o / --output [out_type:]<out_file>` to output the test results to a file.
For possible formats of this file see [FORMAT](docs/FORMAT.md).
For more info about the test suites see [TESTS](docs/TESTS.md).

#### Generate
`-g / --generate [amount]`

Generates batch of EC keypairs and exports them.

Use with `-o / --output [out_file]` to output the generated keys to a file.
Use with `--time` to measure time as a difference of real duration of the operation and the dry-run duration of the operation.
For format of this file see [FORMAT](docs/FORMAT.md).

#### ECDH
`-dh / --ecdh [count]`

Performs ECDH.

Use with `-o / --output [out_file]` to output into a file.
Use with `--time` to measure time as a difference of real duration of the operation and the dry-run duration of the operation.
For format of this file see [FORMAT](docs/FORMAT.md).
Respects the KeyAgreement type specified in `-ka / --ka-type [type]`.


#### ECDSA
`-dsa / --ecdsa [count]`

Performs ECDSA.
Useful with `-i / --input [in_file]` to sign the contents of a file.
Use with `-o / --output [out_file]` to output into a file.
Use with `--time` to measure time as a difference of real duration of the operation and the dry-run duration of the operation.
For format of these files see [FORMAT](docs/FORMAT.md).
Respects the Signature type specified in `-sig / --sig-type [type]`.

#### List named curves
`-ln / --list-named []`

Lists categories of curves, keys and keypairs embedded in ECTester's jar, along with some information about them.
These can be used as arguments to the `-n[c|k|pub|priv] / --named-[curve|key|public|private]` parameters, using the format: `category/name`.

For example:
`secg/secp192r1` identifies the SECG 192 bit prime field curve known as `secp192r1`.

For more info about the curves and curve categories see [CURVES](docs/CURVES.md).

#### List test suites
`-ls / --list-suites`

Lists the implemented test suites and gives their short description.

#### Get applet info
`-nf / --info`

Get and print ECTester applet info from an applet installed on a card.

Outputs:
 - Card ATR
 - Negotiated protocol (T=0/T=1)
 - ECTester applet version
 - ECTester APDU support (basic/extended APDU)
 - JavaCard API version
 - JavaCard cleanup support
 - ECTester internal array sizes and APDU buffer size

### Example

Snippet below shows running the default test suite while simulating(`-s`), so using JCardSim.
This shows that JCardsim simulates 112b Fp support with default curve present and supports ECDH, ECDHC and ECDSA.

#### Legend
 - Some general information about the test suite and card is output first, test data follows after.
 - The **OK**/**NOK** values on the left represent the complete evaluated result of a test, as a test can be expected
   to succeed or fail, this is different than the values on the right:
   - **SUCCESS**: Is **OK**, the test was expected to pass and it did.
   - **FAILURE**: Is **NOK**, the test was expected to pass, but it did not.
   - **UXSUCCESS**: Is **NOK**, the test was expected to fail, but it did not.
   - **XFAILURE**: Is **OK**, the test was expected to fail, and it did.
   - **ERROR**: Is **NOK** an unexpected error during testing arose.
 - The tests can be compounded into compound tests, which are visible as a tree of tests and sub-tests.
 - The duration of non-compound tests is shown in the third column, this is a rough estimate, measured from before the APDU is sent, to just after the response is received.
 - The cause of the test result, is shown in the last column, for non-compound tests, these are JavaCard(or custom) status words, from operations done on the card.

### Setup

OpenJDK JRE is required to test ECDH on Windows properly, as  Oracle JRE requires the Java Cryptography Providers
for certain classes (such as a [KeyAgreement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyAgreement.html)) 
to be signed by keys that are signed by their JCA Code Signing Authority. ECTester internally uses Java Cryptography Provider
API to expose and test native libraries. OpenJDK for Windows can be obtained from [ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild).

Installing the Java Cryptography Extension Unlimited Strength policy files is necessary to do testing
with quite a lot of practical key sizes, they are available for download:

 - [Java 6](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html)
 - [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
 - [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

To install, place them in `${java.home}/jre/lib/security/`.
